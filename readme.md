# Getting Started

This project is based on the [developers.sap.com](https://developers.sap.com/) tutorial 
[Use the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model to Create a Full-Stack App](https://developers.sap.com/group.cp-apm-full-stack-app.html).

## Extension

Using the HANA Web IDE on the HANA Express Edition (HXE) SP03 I've created also a Launchpad Site. But at the first try only an empty page is shown
and the console shows the error “Content-Security-Policy ..”. You have to apply the correction provided in Note 
[2766378 - XSA Fiori site empty page loaded](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2766378) to make this work.
